# Notes-on-Programming-Languages that I have learned.

Disclaimer: I learned most of the information from Youtube and it might not make as much sense without checking out the videos. 
Everybody learns differently, so the way I write my notes may seem confusing so feel free to ask any questions. I would be happy to answer them. 
Most of the information should be correct, there could be typos or mistakes that I haven't found yet, so if you see any, please let me know.

Hope you can learn something from these notes.
